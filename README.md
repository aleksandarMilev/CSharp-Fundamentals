The Programming Fundamentals course is the next step in SoftUni's software engineering program, building on the concepts learned in Programming Basics. It covers more advanced programming topics, including data structures like arrays, lists, and dictionaries, and introduces the fundamentals of OOP with objects and classes. The course dives deeper into string manipulation and regular expressions, while also introducing version control with Git and essential web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and HTTP.
